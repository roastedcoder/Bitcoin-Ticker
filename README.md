* **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface
* set of commands, functions, protocols and objects.
* client <-> server

    client requests and server responses.
    we use api to interact with other's server.

we can require **request** to make http request.

* most of the responses are in **JSON** format so we have to parse JSON to **js-object** to use.
* we can **send** only one response, and to show multiple messages as response we use **write**.
